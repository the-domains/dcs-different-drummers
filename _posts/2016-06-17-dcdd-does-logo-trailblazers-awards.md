# DCDD does Logo Trailblazers Awards

Percussionists from the concert, marching, and jazz bands of DC's Different Drummers performed as a backup drum line for the Bleachers during their performance of "Like a River Runs" for the Logo Trailblazers Awards broadcast on Saturday, June 27th at the Cathedral of St. John the Divine in New York City.

Earlier in the week Logo sent an email to DCDD asking for our involvement in the show. 8 percussionists from across the ensembles came together to form the drum line of 4 snares and 4 basses.

During the ride up to NYC, the drum line learned their music, arranged by Brian Falatko, After a full day of rehearsal, they were given wardrobe and waited backstage for the big moment, introduced by Kelly Osborne and Violet Chachki, winner of season 7 of RuPaul's Drag Race.
