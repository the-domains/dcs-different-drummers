D.C.'s Different Drummers is a lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender music organization welcoming ALL musicians as it fosters pride, inclusivity, and engagement with the greater Washington, D.C. region through music.

D.C.'s Different Drummers is a 501(c)(3) non-profit music organization incorporated in the District of Columbia. We draw membership from the LGBT community and straight supporters in the National Capital Region, and strives to create music and fellowship.

Founded In 1980, D.C.'s Different Drummers has grown significantly in size and breadth; we currently host multiple ensembles, and hold numerous performances of every size and genre throughout the calendar year. More information on specific ensembles can be found in the links below.

The D.C. Different Drummers is a participant in the [Jon Sims Endowment Fund][0]. We are also proud members of [TeamDC][1], founding members of the [Lesbian and Gay Band Association][2], and are Pride Partners of the [Capital Pride Alliance][3].
